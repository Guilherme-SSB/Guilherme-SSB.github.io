Both $F$, $H$ and $G$ are arrays of size $M$, the same as the input signal. The product $H(u)F(u)$ is formed using array multiplication; that is, $G(i, k)=H(i, k)F(i, k)$."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"mL2NE6XA5SkK"},"source":["## Expand LightCurves borders\n","\n","To perform the filtering of the light curves in this work, we will use the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm in  order to convert the signal in its original domain in the frequency domain. The choice of FFT is simple, this algorithm has complexity of $O(N log\\ N)$, while the Discrete-time Fourier transform has complexity $O(N^2)$, where $N$ is the input data size, it means, FFT is much more computationally efficient.\n","\n","\n","However, the FFT has some peculiarities that can lead to problemas and unexpected results. The algorithm is based on the sucessive folding method [Gonzales and Woods, 1992], in other words, it assumes that the input signal is periodic and that the number of samples is an integer and a power of 2, but the \n","second premise is not a requirement general. The first conjecture is quite relevant to not having distortion in the algorithm outout although. Colleting $M$ samples of a signal, which CoRoT did for us, is equivalent to cutting a \n","finite piece of the real signal, i.e., we take a window between $T_1$ and $T_2$ of a defined signal of ${-\\infty}$ to ${+\\infty}$. There is a possibility that this window perfectly represents the oscillations of the original signal,\n","that is contain complete periods of all frequencies, thus we will have a FFT without distortions, but it is statistically unlikely that this will happen. In this case, we will have incomplete periods, which will introduce high frequency\n","distorcions in the signal that, in general, will be found at the ends of the signal.\n","\n"," The reason that distorcions are commonly introduced at the ends of the signal is justified by the way FFT works. \n","Their recursive calculations imply append the end of the signal with it's beginning (from the FFT's premise, we would\n","have a complete peridod), and it is at this conection that unexpected frequencies are introduced. So, to reduce this effect,\n","we will apply the method of expanding the signal edges. Given a sequence $A$, of size $k$, the method consists of adding\n","$N$ points before $A$'s first point, $A[0]$ and $N$ points after its last point, $A[-1]$.
